# The Challenge of Effective Syntax Highlighting in User Interfaces

Syntax highlighting is a crucial feature in programming and text editing environments. It uses colors to differentiate elements of code, helping developers read and understand code faster. However, choosing the right colors for syntax highlighting is not a straightforward task. Many people struggle with color choices, particularly when there are significant differences in contrast between the various colors used. This article explores the complexities of syntax highlighting, the evolving nature of syntaxes, and the challenges faced by users with disabilities in configuring terminal emulators. Finally, we propose a solution for more accessible and effective default settings.

## The Importance of Contrast in Color Choices

The main goal of syntax highlighting is to make code more readable by using different colors for keywords, variables, strings, and other elements. However, if the contrast between these colors is too high or too low, it can strain the eyes and reduce readability. For instance, a bright yellow text on a white background or a dark blue text on a black background can be very difficult to read.

### Light and Dark Background Preferences

Users typically have a preference for either light or dark backgrounds. However, not all colors work well on both. For example, a color scheme that looks great on a dark background might be almost invisible on a light one. This creates a challenge for developers of syntax highlighting themes to create schemes that are versatile and accessible.

## The Lag Between Syntax Changes and Color Schemes

Programming languages and their syntaxes evolve over time. New keywords and constructs are introduced, and existing ones may change. However, color schemes often lag behind these changes, leading to inconsistent highlighting. This can be confusing for developers, especially when certain elements are not highlighted correctly, or at all, due to outdated color schemes.

## Terminal Emulators and Default Settings

Unix terminal emulators are widely used for coding and other tasks. However, their default color settings often leave much to be desired. For example, some terminal emulators default to using dark blue on a black background, which is almost unreadable. The common belief is that if one can't read the text properly, it's due to a misconfigured terminal. However, configuring a terminal is not always straightforward, especially for people with disabilities.

### Accessibility Challenges

For users with visual impairments or color blindness, adjusting terminal settings to achieve readable text can be particularly challenging. The process may require navigating complex settings or using command-line instructions that are not accessible to everyone. This makes the default color settings even more critical.

## The Growing Use of Colors in CLI Applications

More and more command-line interface (CLI) applications are using colors to highlight important information, differentiate between types of output, and enhance usability. While this trend can improve the user experience for many, it also poses challenges, particularly when combined with problematic default terminal settings.

### The Case for Default Monochrome Output

Given the difficulties in choosing universally readable color schemes and the added complexity for users with visual impairments, it may be better for CLI applications to default to monochrome (colorless) output. This would ensure that all users can read the output without issues related to color contrast or accessibility. Users who prefer color-enhanced output could then enable it through configuration options.

## Proposed Solution: Accessible Default Settings

To address these issues, we propose that terminal emulators adopt two default settings to enhance accessibility and readability:

1. **Light Gray on Nearly Black**: This provides a high-contrast, low-glare option that is easy on the eyes, particularly in low-light environments.
2. **Black on White**: This is a classic, high-contrast option that works well in well-lit environments and is familiar to many users.

By offering these two default options, terminal emulators can ensure that users have a good starting point, regardless of their lighting conditions or visual impairments.

## Conclusion

Effective syntax highlighting is essential for code readability and productivity. However, the challenges of choosing the right colors, keeping up with evolving syntaxes, and ensuring accessibility make it a complex task. By adopting more accessible default settings for terminal emulators, we can make a significant improvement in the user experience for all developers, particularly those with disabilities. Light gray on nearly black and black on white are two default schemes that strike a balance between contrast, readability, and accessibility, providing a solid foundation for any coding environment.
